## The Long Night (2020)

> After I read the original story by Zijin Chen. I think the director made a good restoration in this stream drama. Since the story came across three different timelines, we put a lot of effort into the sound design to shape every single scene. Additionally, I recorded the timebox for my work. I spent 80 hours on Dialogue Editing, 60 hours on Ambience Design, and 30 hours on SFX Design. All things considered, I spent almost 200 hours on this project. This is just a part of the teamwork. The re-recording mixer spent a mass of days working with the director. Another challenge is that we had to deal with a lot of ADR to pass the censor which is definitely damaging to this drama.
