Hi there! It's nice to meet you in this way. I'm Zhao Jian (Jere), currently working as a game sound designer at Electronic Arts based in Shanghai, and at the beginning of my career is film. However, the art of film still plays an important role in my life, and is even a part of me that I can't lose. So I'm here to document my film stories. If these stories inspire you, I will be super happy.

If you find it boring (actually it is), you can take a look at [my sound works](https://www.youtube.com/@zhaojian/videos), and I hope you will enjoy them.
