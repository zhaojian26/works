Hello! I am a sound designer. I design sound and music for films, games, visual art, and any other forms whenever we need sound. The film is the start of my career and still being a significant part of my life. So I wrote down the memories of films that I have worked on, it means a lot to me. If it can inspire you, I would be super happy.

If you are not interested in these stories. it is fine. There are some other works beyond the film. Hope you can enjoy it! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1zijzn8qPG5BK8-dVRDRQQ
