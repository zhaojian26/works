This piece is a special one. During the whole production period, I didn’t meet the director Yan Kun’ao in real life as he was in New York, not to say shaking hands or having a meal. But the fact is we built a strong trust via a video call. I found that he is such a focusing and pure filmmaker. He has a unique emotion in his own film, and so do I. When I watch the demo, I felt so close and I can almost touch the summer aroma from north China. It brings me back to the sleepy afternoon when my grandma used to accompany me during every summer vacation. I give my best wish to the big boy who treasures the memory of his hometown.
