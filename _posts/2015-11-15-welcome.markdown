Hello! I am a sound designer. I design sound and music for films, games, visual art and any other forms whenever we need sound.Film is the start of my career and still being an significant part of my life. So I wrote down the memories of films that I have worked on, it means a lot to me. If it can inspire you, I would be super happy.

If you are not interested in these stories. it is fine. There are some other works that beyond the film. Hope you can enjoy!
